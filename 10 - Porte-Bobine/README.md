# Porte-Bobine

The objective of this project was to create a support for filament coils to avoid chaos while storing them.

It was also needed to create blueprints of the pieces in order to ensure a production as soon as finished.

Another system has been tried before, without much success, consisting in a tube holding the coils. Due to a lack of practicality, this system is now abandoned in favor of this one.
