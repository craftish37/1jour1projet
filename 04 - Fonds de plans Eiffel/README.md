# Fonds de plan Eiffel

During this project, my aim was to simplify the creation of blueprints in Solidworks for every section of the school. It has been achieved by integrating an auto-filling function in the title block, where you just need to double-click the region to fill in simple infos about your creation.

Note that the cross-square zones are replacable with the told data by the person completing the blueprint.
