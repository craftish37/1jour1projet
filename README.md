# 1jour1projet

**1jour1projet** is a mid-long term creation project which occured between `01/16/23` and `02/10/23`


## Presentation

During this period, 20 projects have been finished, thanks to the use of different CAD softwares :

 - **[Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/)** for the main creation of shapes and designs
 - **[Ultimaker Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura)** for the creation of files used for 3D printing
 - **[3D Builder](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/3d-builder/9WZDNCRFJ3T6?)** for complements on the 3D printing parts

## Projects details

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">1 - Modèle-params</summary>
The aim of this project was to create a solid reliable enough to judge if your 3D printer parameters are satisfying and work as intended. In the SolidPart, you will find a color code, each color defining a parameter to test.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">2 - Cache Clavier</summary>
This project, while being pretty simple, is the reproduciton of my keyboard frame that I unfortunately damaged during the creation...
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">3 - Bescherelle</summary>
This model a complete Bescherelle (a French book recensing almost every way and rule to write in french) created for the dear BTS CPI - 1st year section. 100% printable with the files there, you just have to slice it with convenient parameters and glue the parts together.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">4 - Fonds de plans Eiffel</summary>
During this project, my aim was to simplify the creation of blueprints on Solidworks for every section of the school. It has been achieved by integrating an auto-filling function in the title block, where you just need to double-click the region to fill simple infos about your creation.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">5 - Adventurer4 sur Cura</summary>
This project is a document that can be used to install parameters of the Adventurer4 3D pinter on Cura on both a server and a single user.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">6 - Trophée Cosmetica</summary>
See <a href=”https://github.com/craftish37/W.I.P“>6 - Cosmetica</a>
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">7 - Support cartouches insuline</summary>
This model has been created to be printed for my cousin, who has diabete. It is intented from the shape to be able to hold in a vertical position insulin doses while respecting the old model (the green body).
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">8 - Étude de moulage</summary>
This project is a work I "grabbed" from the BTS - 1st year section in order to work on my capabilities in creating molds for pieces.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">9 - Tour Eiffel</summary>
This is the re-creation of an old project where we couldn't find the solidparts anymore, remaining graphical bodies only.
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">10 - Porte bobine</summary>
The objective of this project was to create a support for filament coils to avoid chaos while storing them. It was also needed to create blueprints of the pieces in order to ensure a production as soon as finished.

## Thanks

This project has been made possible thanks to **Cosmetica** and **Gustave Eiffel's Vocational School** where I'm actively studying

## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$
