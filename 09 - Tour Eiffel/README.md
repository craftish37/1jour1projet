# Tour Eiffel

This is the re-creation of an old project where we couldn't find the solidparts anymore, remaining graphical bodies only.

Most of the graphical bodies are a bit distorted during the conversion to printable file formats, which made this project quite difficult since the scale of the models was small. However, the final product worth the show.
