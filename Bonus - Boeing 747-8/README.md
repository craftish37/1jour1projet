# Boeing 747-8

This project is the achievement of more than 40 days of work, smoothly distributed along the days.

> The Boeing 747-8 is a wide-body airliner formerly developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, and the largest variant of the 747. - Wikipedia

Everything came from a challenge : "Well, if you'll be an engineer, just make a plane already"

Since this plane was the only one I found precise enough measures, it's this one who got the chance to see the light of the day !

This has been an occasion to train me to fast creations and spline manipulation.
